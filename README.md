**ARc** (Atomic React) is a React starter kit based on the [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology. It's progressive, which means that you can start with the basic boilerplate and try the other features when you are comfortable.

See the [demo](https://arc.js.org).

## Branches

### [master](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc)

The basic stack with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) and [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).

### [redux](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc/tree/redux)

Master plus [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), [redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga) and [redux-form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form).

### [universal-redux](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc/tree/universal-redux)

Redux plus [Server Side Rendering](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/docs/recipes/ServerRendering.md) (*everything works with javascript disabled, even the forms*).

### [fullstack](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc/tree/fullstack)

Universal plus REST API.

### [generator-arc](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc/tree/generator-arc)

Generate components, containers, redux stores and the entire project through a CLI utility.

## Forks

*Did you fork this repo and make something different? Add it to this section and send a PR.*

## Why

I've been a web developer for the past 14 years and after dealing with IE vs. Netscape wars, `<table>` layouts and flash websites, I can say that we are now living in the best moment in web development. Web components are awesome and React makes it better.

React encourages you to create very small and pure components. However, as your project grows, you will have an increasingly complex components folder. At some point, this will be really huge and hard to maintain.

I had a React project with more than 100 components in the `components` folder. The first approach I tried to organize it was separating the components by domain (described [here](http://marmelab.com/blog/2015/12/17/react-directory-structure.html)), but I realized that most of my components didn't belong to any domain, but were shared. This meant that my problems just moved to the `commons` folder.

The [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) approach comes handy to solve this problem because it considers the reusability through composition, *which is actually what React is*. You will have your minimal/stylish components in one folder, pages in another and so on.

## Download

Just clone the repository and remove the `.git` folder:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/diegohaz/arc my-app
$ cd my-app
$ rm -rf .git
$ npm install # or yarn
```

## Usage

- [Run](#run)
- [Deploy](#deploy)
- [Source code](#source-code)
- [Components](#components)
  - [Storybook](#storybook)

### Run

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can use `npm start` to run a development server.

### Deploy

Use `npm run build` to transpile the code into the `dist` folder. Then, you can deploy it everywhere.

### Source code

The source code should be placed in `src`; public/static files should be placed in `public` so they can be included in the build process.

Because of [webpack's config](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc/blob/5c752968c52d013f7218b514021eae08f6ddf07c/webpack.config.js#L19-L21), we can import our source modules without relative paths.
```js
import { Button, HomePage } from 'components' // src/components
import App from 'components/App' // src/components/App
import routes from 'routes' // src/routes
```

### Components

This project leverages the [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology to create a scalable and easy to maintain component folder structure. See [why](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc#why).

However, Atomic Design should be a solution, **not another problem**. If you want to create a component and don't know where to put it (`atoms`, `molecules`, `organisms` etc.), **do not worry, do not think too much, just put it anywhere**. After you realize what it is, just move the component folder to the right place. Everything else should work.

<p align="center"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3068563/21237760/6b941f76-c2e7-11e6-92e3-bbb7c82b3622.gif"></p>

This is possible because all components are dynamically exported on [`src/components/index.js`](src/components/index.js) and imported in a way that Atomic Design structure doesn't matter:

```js
import { Button, Hero, HomePage, PageTemplate } from 'components'
```

To better understand the Atomic Design methodology, you can refer to the [`src/components`](src/components) folder here and the [Pattern Lab Demo](http://demo.patternlab.io/), which this project is based on. Basically, you can think this way:

- An **atom** is a native html tag or a React Component that renders an html tag (e.g [`Input`](src/components/atoms/Input/index.js));
- A **molecule** is a group of atoms (e.g. [`Field`](src/components/molecules/Field/index.js));
- An **organism** is a group of atoms, molecules and/or other organisms (e.g. [`Form`](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc/blob/redux/src/components/organisms/PostForm/index.js));
- A **page** is... a page, where you will put mostly organisms (e.g. [`HomePage`](src/components/pages/HomePage/index.js));
- A **template** is a layout to be used on pages, see [why templates are good practice](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc/issues/20#issuecomment-265934388).

#### Storybook

I highly recommend you to incorporate [react-storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/react-storybook) on your development process. It really improves productivity and the developer experience. Actually, most of the time you can just use the storybook instead of the real webapp while creating components.

This already comes with the boilerplate and you can simply use `npm run storybook` to get it running. But, if you don't want that, just run:
```sh
rm -rf .storybook # remove .storybook folder
npm u -S @kadira/storybook # remove storybook dependency
```

## Contributing

When submitting an issue, use the following patterns in the title for better understanding:
```bash
[v0.3.1-redux] Something wrong is not right # the v0.3.1 release of the redux branch
[redux] Something wrong is not right # the actual code of the redux branch
Something wrong is right # general, related to master or not directly related to any branch
```

PRs are very appreciated. For bugs/features consider creating an issue before sending a PR. But there are other things you can contribute directly:

- I'm not a native english speaker. If you find any typo or some text that could be written in a better way, please send a PR, even if it is only a punctuation;
- If you forked or created another boilerplate based on this one with another features (using [`css-modules`](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) instead of [`styled-components`](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components), for example), add that to the [Forks section](#forks) with the following pattern:
  - [arc-css-modules](https://github.com/username/arc-css-modules) - A short description
